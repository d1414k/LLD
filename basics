Class Diagram 
REF : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4h8yOTunss

Its part of UML->Structural diagram
It has 3 sections (class Name, atrributes, funtions)
Attributes and functions can be private , public or protected (rep as : -,+,#)


Relationships between classes
1. Association    

Rep as : --------------------- (single line)
Ex:  [student]--------------[Teacher]
              teaches to |>
2. Dependency

Rep as : ...............>  (dotted line followed by arrow)
Ex:
 [consumer]--------->[suplier]
 
3. Aggrigation  (has a relationship)
Rep as ---------------<> (single line followed by unfilled diamond shape)
Ex:

[library]<|---------------<>[book]
(container class)       (contained class)

Note : contained class does not have strong dependency on life cycle of container class 
means if there is no library even we can have books

4. Composition
It is similar to Aggregation but contained class have strong dependency on life cycle of container class 
Rep as ---------------<> (single line followed by filled diamond shape)

5. Generalization
known as "is a" relationship

Rep as : -----------------|> (straight line followed by arraow)
Arrow will be towards super class

Ex : 

                       [Person]
                          ^
                          |
                          |
          "is a"          |
         |--------------------------------|
         |                                |
         |                                |
         |                                |
     [Student]                         [Teacher]


Here person is super class and Student, Teacher is subclass
